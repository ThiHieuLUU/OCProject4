Here are two test cases for the verification of the implemented algorithm which builds the pairs of players for a match
under the condition: two players must not be encountered before.

If at a step, the current pair can not be built because there are only two players and they encountered before,
the algorithm will return to the previous pair and re-make the previous pair, then try to make the current pair. This is
repeated until the above condition is satisfied.

These test cases will show that the problem appears at the round 4 and it is resolved with the above algorithm.

I. List of players
In the method 'get_players(cls)' of player.py, uncomment:
        # list_of_players = [players[i] for i in range(1, 9, 1)]


II. Scores (player_1 vs player_2) to test:
